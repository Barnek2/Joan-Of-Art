<h2>Welcome to Joan Of Art </h2>
<h2>about the artist </h2>
<p>   If you are reading this, it’s because you found my website, Joan of Art Designs. I love art, and the many different forms of it … The art of cooking, the art of crafting, the art of floral arranging, the art of gardening, the art of friendship …  a few years ago, I decided to turn my love of the arts into something others can enjoy, too. Here you can visit the multiple facets of my business and shop my online store. See how I intertwine the arts into my daily life and make everything just a little brighter and more beautiful and shop my site to make your world a little more beautiful, too. </p>
