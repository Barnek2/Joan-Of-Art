<h2> About the Artist </h2>

  <p>If you are reading this, it’s because you found my website, Joan of Art Designs. I love art, and the many different forms of it … The art of cooking, the art of crafting, the art of floral arranging, the art of gardening, the art of friendship …  a few years ago, I decided to turn my love of the arts into something others can enjoy, too.</p>
  <p>Here you can visit the multiple facets of my business and shop my online store. See how I intertwine the arts into my daily life and make everything just a little brighter and more beautiful and shop my site to make your world a little more beautiful, too. </p>
